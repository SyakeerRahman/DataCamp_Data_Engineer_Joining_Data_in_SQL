# DataCamp_Data_Engineer_Joining_Data_in_SQL

Joining data is an essential skill which enables us to draw information from separate tables together into a single, meaningful set of results. Learn to supercharge queries using table joins and relational set theory in this course on joining data.
In this course, i learn how to:
✓ Work with more than one table in SQL
✓ Use inner joins, outer joins and cross joins
✓ Leverage set theory, including unions, intersect, and except clauses
✓ Create nested queries
Every step is accompanied by exercises and opportunities to apply the theory and grow my confidence in SQL.
